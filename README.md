Licks
=====

Licks is meant to be a frontend for a music analysis platform / api that I'm working on. (see epitome)
I would like record microphone input from the browser and send it to the backend where it
will be processed with the sound processing library/API I'm working on.

Ideally I'd like the user to be able to play their guitar or saxophone or whatever and have
the notes they're playing appear on the screen.
